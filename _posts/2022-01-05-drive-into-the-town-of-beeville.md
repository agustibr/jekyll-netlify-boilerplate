Fresh out of college and trying to find his way in the creative world, Roberto Benavidez ditched bronze sculpting in favor of something closer to home. He’s since spent a decade using piñatas to create paintings and sculptures.

Drive into the town of Beeville, Texas and on the approach you’ll see a dusty baby pink and blue sign featuring old-timey lettering and some sweet little cartoon bees. It’s incredibly cute.
